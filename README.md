This repo is inspired by some visualization music players on the web.

I hava recently studyed canvas API, drag and drop API, audio API, and requestAnimationFrame ... These techs are new to html5 and they are awesome! So I decided to write a visulazation music player by myself. I will build it step by step, that means I will not import any extra techs during this process until I think it is helpful enough to do this. I set up this goal because there are so many front end techs nowadays: gulp, npm, babel, webpack, react and etc. I will not use any of these until I think it is necessary to.
